pyBAI 
===== 

Provides RS232 communications with Aerotech BA-Intellidrive PID servo
controllers. This package does not implement the full serial
interface, but rather just the subset required to: read and write the
drive parameters, save the parameters to flash, read status
information, reset the drive, and toggle the communications mode. This
was sufficient for my purposes. I did lay the ground work for
implementing the rest of the serial interface, but I don't at the
moment I don't have the time (or the need) to implement it.
